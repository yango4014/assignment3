        "2. What is the shape of `X_train` and `X_test`? What is the shape of `X_train[i]` and `X_test[i]` for each index `i`? What is the shape of `y_train` and `y_test`?\n",
        "3. Use Numpy's `.reshape()` method to covert the training and testing data from a matrix into an vector of features. So, `X_test[index].reshape((1,784))` will convert the $index$-th element of `X_test` into a $28\\times 28=784$-length row vector of values, rather than a matrix. Turn `X_train` into an $N \\times 784$ matrix $X$ that is suitable for scikit-learn's kNN classifier where $N$ is the number of observations and $784=28*28$ (you could use, for example, a `for` loop).\n",
        "4. Use $k$ means clustering on the reshaped `X_test` data with `k=10`.  \n",
        "5. Cross tabulate the cluster assignments with the true labels for the test set values. How good is the correspondence? What proportion of digits are clustered correctly? Which digits are the hardest to distinguish from one another? Can $k$MC recover the latent digits 0 to 9, without even knowing what those digits were?\n",
        "6. If you use a scree plot to determine the number of clusters $k$, does it pick 10 (the true number of digits), or not? If it fails to pick $k=10$, which digits does it tend to combine into the same classification?"
